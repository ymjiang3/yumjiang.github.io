I am an Assistant Professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA.
My work focuses on the development and application of novel machine learning and deep learning approaches for radiology/pathology image analysis and precision oncology. This can lead to the discovery of image-based biomarkers for clinical applications including treatment response and prognosis prediction, cancer detection and diagnosis, which have the potential to transform cancer care. My work spans across multiple image domains and modalities including radiology and histopathology image data. These data sets are linked with clinical outcomes to address a specific unmet clinical need. Further, we integrate images with matched genomic/molecular data to gain more insight into cancer biology.
